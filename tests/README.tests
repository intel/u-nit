Testing init involves some different approaches, like unit testing and
fuzzy (currently, for inittab parser only) or qemu testing.

Unit test

Only for inittab parser at this moment. Perform some tests for
`inittab_parse_entry` function.

To generate unit test executable, run `make tests`. It should generate
`parser_test` executable - which must run with no issues.

Fuzzy testing

American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) is run on a single executable, using
`tests/data/parser` files as input for the fuzzy tool.

To generate AFL ready executable, run `make tests`. It should generate
`afl_parser_test` executable - that can be run with a command like
`afl-fuzz -i tests/data -o fuzz-results/ ./afl_parser_test @@`.
See AFL documentation for more details.

QEMU testing

Runs init as PID 1 on a virtual environment using qemu. This virtual
environment needs a kernel image and rootfs. Currently, script that
perform this testing expects a directory `tests/init-qemu`, with files
`bzImage` - kernel image, `rootfs.ext2` - the root file system of
the environment and `gcov.ext4` - where coverage obtained by gcov is
stored.

Tests for qemu environment are defined using two files: XXX-inittab and
XXX-inspect for each test XXX. These files live in `tests/data/qemu`
directory. First file defines an inittab file, with all programs that
should be run. Second one defines inspections to be done on init log
file.

The inittab file can use some helper executables to perform its tests.
One is the `sleep_test`, which receives as command line arguments an
arbitrary string and a number. The arbitrary string can be used to
inspect init log file. The number is for how long, in seconds, the
program will sleep. After period finishes, program quits. This can help
test if program B starts only after program A runs.

Another helper is the `sleep_crash_test`, that takes the same two
arguments as `sleep_test`, but it ends with a crash after the timer.
Can be helpful to see if a safe program crashes abnormally, for
instance.

Finally, there are two more helpers: `is_running` and `is_not_running`.
They take as argument a regular expression to be run on `ps aux`
command. Helper `is_running` will log failure if a regular expression
is not found on `ps aux` output, `is_not_running` does the opposite.
They should help to see if a process is really running or not on a given
moment. Useful to test if a service is up, for instance. Note that
the regular expression must not match itself on `ps aux` output - or it
would have wrong results, as it appears on it. A good way to achieve
this is to start the regular expression with `[[]`.

To start shutdown on virtual environment, add a `kill -s USR2 1` on
inittab file, so init will perform shutdown steps.

The inspect file runs some regular expressions on init log file. Note
that log file also contains any output of programs started by init -
except those that define a controlling terminal. For instance, on start,
`sleep_test` prints `START: /usr/bin/sleep_test <string> <timeout>`.
Regular expressions are defined on three bash arrays variables: EXPECT,
EXPECT_IN_ORDER and NOT_EXPECT. The first searches for each expression
on the array on init log file, and expect that they appear on log,
in the same order they defined on the array. The second simply expects
that each expression appears on init log file, and the last doesn't
expect them at all.

In order to mount the rootfs to send files to virtual environment,
this test needs root permissions. To run it, simply run
`make run-qemu-tests`.
If some test fails, check `qemu-tests.log` file to see what happened.

Coverage information of QEMU tests can also be extracted: run
`make run-qemu-tests-coverage`. This will compile init with coverage
support (`make coverage`), run the tests using QEMU, extract the
coverage information and run `lcov`
(http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) to get a nice view of
coverage. It should open the browser to show coverage information.

Valgrind testing

Runs init as PID 1 inside container environment under Valgrind.
Container is used instead of QEMU because it easily makes `/proc`
available for Valgrind. (On QEMU /proc wouldn't be mounted until
init mount it.)

This tests perform all tests on `tests/data/qemu` directory with init
under Valgrind, checking for memory issues. If any is found, this
check should fail and show Valgrind output on `qemu-tests.log`.

To run these tests, run `make run-valgrind-tests`.

Note that Valgrind doesn't implement `reboot` syscall, so it will
complain about "syscall 169 not implemented". This should not be an
issue. Indeed, as `reboot` call fails, init shall exit with exit code
1 (`EXIT_FAILURE`), due to `reboot` call failure. On container
environment this is not an issue - container will simply exit. This
even allows some cleanup code to run - currently, on normal execution,
`reboot` is called before cleanup, so it never happens.

Naturally, this test expect that Valgrind is available on target image
 - rootfs.ext2.

Container being used for tests is systemd-nspawn (minimum
systemd-version: 233)
[https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html].
Note that to run the container, root permissions are necessary.

ASAN testing

Runs init as PID 1 inside container environment with AdressSanitizer
enabled [https://github.com/google/sanitizers]. Container is used
instead of QEMU because it easily makes `/proc` available from ASAN.
(On QEMU /proc wouldn't be mounted until init mount it.)

This tests perform all tests on `tests/data/qemu` directory with init
with ASAN, checking for memory issues. If any is found, this
check should fail and show ASAN output on `qemu-tests.log`.

To run these tests, first ensure that init is compiled with address
sanitizer support, running `make init-asan`, then, to executed the
tests, run `make run-asan-tests`.

Note that an abrupt end of init - like calling `reboot` - doesn't give
a chance to ASAN output its data. To easily allow that and to keep
consistency with behaviour when running under Valgrind, init doesn't
call `reboot` if compiled with address sanitizer. So it will end up
running all clean up code and exit with exit code 1 (`EXIT_FAILURE`),
just like when init runs under Valgrind.

This test expect that AddressSanitizer libraires are available on
target image - rootfs.ext2.

Container being used for tests is systemd-nspawn (minimum
systemd-version: 233)
[https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html].
Note that to run the container, root permissions are necessary.
