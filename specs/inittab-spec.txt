Init, as the process that sets userspace up, needs to know which process
are necessary as well as any dependence amog them, so that if process B
must be started after process A, init has a way to ensure that.

A common way to achieve this feature is having init read a file that
specifies process to be started and some metadata about them, allowing
start order to be respected.

This specification denotes an inittab file that should be simple to
write and parse, yet have all metadata deemed necessary to fulfill init
features.

Init inittab file can have multiple one-line entries on the form:

<order>:<core-id>:<type>:<controlling-terminal>:<process>

<order> Unsigned number defining a relative order in which process will
be run. For instance, STL could be ‘0’, so it would be the first process
run. Two process with the same order are started in the order they
appear on file, from top to bottom. A process on a next order is only
started after all process on preceding order are terminated, unless they
are of type ‘service’ - if only process of type ‘service’ are left on
current order, init moves to next order. Can only be blank for
‘safe-mode’ <type>.

<core-id> CPU core-id number to which the process is bound. If left
blank, no CPU binding is done. A very important note: there’s only one
‘trusted’ way to prevent any other process from running on a core:
remove that core from kernel scheduler using ‘isolcpus’ kernel command
line parameter. So, init needs an AoU that integrator will properly
use this kernel command line parameter. Without it, init can set process
X affinity to core 2, but can’t prevent process Y from running on core 2
as well, for instance.

<type> Types of process. Can be <one-shot>, <service>, <safe-one-shot>,
<safe-service>, <safe-mode>, <shutdown> or <safe-shutdown>. Init only
starts process on a greater order iff all <one-shot> and <safe-one-shot>
are terminated on current order. <safe-mode> is the application that
will be started by init to bring system to safe state. This should
happen only if a <safe-one-shot>, <safe-service> or <safe-shutdown> are
abnormally terminated (crash). Note that this process ‘order’ is ignored
- so it can be left blank. Only one <safe-mode> entry is allowed on
inittab.
Types <shutdown> and <safe-shutdown> are like their ‘one-shot’
counterparts, but are run during system shutdown.  Order is still
respected, so two process with different order numbers will be started
from the one with smaller order to the next.

<controlling-terminal> Path of controlling terminal for the process, e.g.
`/dev/tty1` or `/dev/console`. This field can be left blank, in which
case process will not have a controlling terminal, its `stdin` will
point to `/dev/null` (so each read would result on EOF) and `stdout` and
`stderr` will both point to init own log file. If field is provided,
`stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` will be attached to the terminal. If
more than one process use the same controlling terminal, only the first
one gets it, and other processes won't start.

<process> Process that will be started with all command line options.
For <safe-service> process, command line options may contain tags <proc>
and <exitcode>, that will be substituted for process name (with command
line options) and exit code by init. Note that parsing command
line is hard, so a good way to start would simply issue command content
to bash, for instance.

Example:
0::<safe-one-shot>:/usr/bin/stl
1:0:<safe-service>:/usr/bin/safe-service1
1:1:<safe-service>:/usr/bin/safe-service2 --production
::<safe-mode>:/usr/bin/safe-mode -p <proc> -c <exitcode>
0::<safe-shutdown>:/usr/bin/stl --keyoff

In this sample, if ‘safe-service2’ application crashes with segmentation
fault, ‘safe-mode’ application will be called with:

/usr/bin/safe-mode -p “/usr/bin/safe-service2 --production” -c 11

Lines starting with # character are considered comment lines, so they
are ignored. Note that it's not possible to comment a line after its
end, so that following example is not a comment:

0::<safe-one-shot>:/usr/bin/stl #Not a comment

Init will simply issue "#Not a comment" as parameters to
`/usr/bin/stl`.

On inittab, lines cannot be arbitrarily long: no line, be it an entry or
a commentary, can have more than 4095 characters.
