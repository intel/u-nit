1. Introduction

Init is the first process started after the kernel boots the computer and is
responsible for bringing up and maintaining userspace services. Init needs to
know which process are necessary as well as any dependence among them, so that
if process B must be started after process A, init has a way to ensure that.

1.1. Purpose

This document provides an overview of the Init and is intended to cover and
convey the important architectural decisions made.

1.2. Scope

This document is limited to an explaination of the implemented Init, its
architectural goals and constraints as well as its assumptions of use and
functionalities.

It contains high-level diagrams that describe how the different components
interact with each other.

2. Design method

This software follows a minimalism approach, which means it is designed with
few functionalities and to use the least hardware and software resources
possible.

The functionalities are derived from requirements in a way that each
functionality can be traced to one or more requirement.

The implementation is guided by the MISRA-C [1], which is a set of software
guidelines for the C language. MISRA-C aims to enhance safety, security
and reliability in embedded systems.

3. Requirements

 - Initialize, configure and feed a watchdog
 - Mount necessary filesystems
 - Launch other services considering order and criticality
 - Inform designed application when a "safe/critical" application crashes
 - Must disable CTRL-ALT-DEL key combination
 - Be a session leader
 - Properly handle signals
 - Only run if it was started by the Linux Kernel
 - Handle shutdown and reboot
 - Handle the exit of a child process
 - Sanitize the child process terminal
 - Configure properly its own file creation mask
 - Do not leak file descriptors for child process

3. Architectural Representation

To make easier to understand the architecture, this document decomposes the
Init in five different components. This is only conceptual division based on
functionalities, there is no explicitly separation in the build and the
components can be implemented in more than one file.

Below is an overview of the Init logic:

+----------------+                                           +----------------+

3.1. Main

This is the biggest component and is responsible for controlling the
application life-cycle (mainloop), sanitizing terminals, configuring the file
creating mask, mounting the filesystems, configuring and feeding the watchdog
and handling the shutdown/reboot process.

The mainloop is responsible for waiting and dispatching events or messages,
when there is nothing to handle, the mainloop waits in a way that does not
waste computer resources. This mainloop is implemented using epoll()[2], which
means synchronous and Linux specific.

The mainloop can be awakened by two things; when a timer expires or when it
receives a signal. In both cases, a given callback -- one per signal and one
per timeout --  is called. After handling the signals and the timeouts, the
mainloop calls a post-iteration callback, if defined, and returns to the
epoll().

It is possible to add multiple timeouts. Each one can contain its own
callback, but only one signal handler callback and one mask. The Init
explicitly handles four signals:

 - SIGCHLD - To monitor started process
 - SIGTERM - Signal that can be used by external process to reboot the system
 - SIGUSR1 - Signal that can be used by external process to halt the system
 - SIGUSR2 - Signal that can be used by external process to shutdown the system

The mainloop monitors the signals using the syscall signalfd()[3]. It receives
a signal mask then creates a file descriptor, using the signalfd(), that is
then monitored by epoll().

3.2. SignalHandler

The SignalHandler is the component responsible for taking the correct action
when a signal is received. This Init does not handle signals using the
syscalls, signal()[4] and sigaction()[5]. Instead, it uses the syscall
signalfd().

The signalfd() has the advantage of creating a file descriptor from a signal
mask that may be monitored by the epoll(). This allows Init to monitor the
signals and timeouts in the same place, turning the code clear.

When a signal is received, the file descriptor wakes the mainloop that calls
the handler associated with the specified signal. A list with the signals and
its specific actions is described below:

 - SIGCHLD

  The handler for this signal reaps all child processes that died. There can be
  multiple SIGCHLD coalesced in one signalfd entry, so this function calls
  waitpid()[6] as many times as necessary, then checks the type of each child
  process.  If the died process is a "safe-process" and it has finished
  abnormally or crashed, Init is conducted to a "safe-mode", else if the
  process is "one-shot" kind, the list that controls how many "one-shot"
  process are pending is decreased, otherwise the process is just removed from
  the monitored process.

 - SIGTERM
 - SIGUSR1
 - SIGUSR2

 These signals share the same handler, which starts the shutdown process,
 terminating all the running process and informing the mainloop about it. After
 all process have been finished, the syscall reboot()[7] with the proper
 parameter to reboot, halt or shuttdown the system.

3.3. Spawner

The spawner component is responsible for launching the processes described in
the "inittab" file.

It creates a new process using fork()[8] and then configures the environment
for this process before replacing this new process with a new process image.
The procedures executed in this process to setup the environment are:

 - Reset the signal mask logic
 - Become a session leader
 - Configure a controlling terminal (if specified in its inittab entry)
 - Configure stdin/stdout/stderr. It points to the controlling terminal, if
   specified, otherwise stdin points to /dev/nulll and stdout/stderr points
   to the same file used by the Init to log.

3.4. Logger

Logger is the component responsible for centralizing all debug messages. The
default output is /dev/ttyS1 that is the second serial port, this output
can be overridden during the build using the flag -DLOG_FILE.

The function defined in this component has the same behavior of the
printf()[9] but the only allows message up to 256 characters.

3.5. Parser

This component is responsible for the task executed before starting the
processes and is closely related to the inittab configuration. Details about
the syntax allowed are described in detail in spec/inittab-spec.txt.

The entry point for this module is the function that reads an inittab file and
returns a list with all process entries. A process entry is a struct that
described which process must be started, what is its category, and how to
launch it.

4. Architectural Goals and Constraints

The architecture was defined considering the functionals requirements and the
environment/use-case that it is intended to be used. These requirements have a
significant bearing on the architecture:

 - The Init requires an "inittab" file in the exact format described in
   spec/inittab-spec.txt.
 - Init requires Linux OS, it is not intended to run in any other OS.
 - It requires glibc >= 2.9
 - Init must be the first process running the in the machine.

5. Using Init

There are two ways that the user can interact with this software. One is
through its configuration file and the other is sending specific signals to
perform well-defined actions.

5.1 Configuration

As mentioned in the introduction, Init needs to know which process must start
and any dependence among them, it means, if process B must be started after
process A, Init has a way to ensure that.

The way Init achieves this feature is by reading a file that describes the
processes to be started and additional information about them, that specifies
the order and priority in order to be respected.

The inittab file can have multiple one-line entries on the form:

<order>:<core-id>:<type>:<controlling-terminal>:<process>

More information about the individual parameters can be found in
specs/inittab-spec.txt.

5.2 Signals

An external application can ask Init to take an action sending a signal. The
signal can be sent using the syscall kill()[9]. Init only accepts signals from
process with the same user ID (UID).

The signals and the Init actions are:

 - SIGTERM - reboot the system
 - SIGUSR1 - halt the system
 - SIGUSR2 - shutdown the system
